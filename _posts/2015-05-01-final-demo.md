##Demo Video

This is a brief explanation of our project as well as a video showing how our web console can send commands to the robot to navigate to a point using closed loop control.

##Final Robot and Web Console Code

In the end, we were able to implement close-loop control and autonomous A-to-B navigation using the localization algorithm based upon the Hector transform. All of the source code for our project is viewable on our [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/moward/project-winwood)
